# [**Project 2: Prediction mode of transportation taken by individual based on their salary and age.**]
This is a project that I did by following the tutorial from the instructor during my learning of Naive Bayes classification.

* Data was provided by the instructor and included in my Github
* Algorithms used: Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes Classifier. 
* This algorithms supports continuous data 
* Assumes that continuous values associated with each class and distributed according to a normal (or Gaussian) distribution.
* In this project, the model classified the mode of transportation whether it is LRT or car based on the given age and salary.
